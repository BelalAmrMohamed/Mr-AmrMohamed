## Application
Make the website an installable app.

Online First rules (for users that install the app):
- When the user is only, they always and always pull the code from the host, not the offline cached code. We aren't going to use a service worker version, because I always forget to increament it when updating.
- When the user is offline, the cached code gets displayed with a very tiny offline banner at the bottom of the screen, that has a cancel button.
- When the user is online they always update the cached code.
- Users that didn't instal the app never cache anything at all.
